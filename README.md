I developed this project as an integral component of the "REACT Basics" module within the Front-End Developer career path offered by Scrimba. This project is meticulously crafted using the REACT framework. The primary objective of this project is to showcase my proficiency in leveraging CSS and JavaScript to create an elegant yet straightforward travel journal. For each location, users are presented with a captivating photo, detailed location information, a descriptive narrative, current temperature data, distance traveled, and the date of my visit. The user-friendly interface is equipped with navigation buttons that allow seamless transitions to explore subsequent destinations. This project serves as a testament to my skill set, highlighting my ability to design and develop aesthetically pleasing and functional web applications.
